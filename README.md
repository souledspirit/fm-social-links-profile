## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of basic HTML structure and CSS styling, particularly with layout using Flexbox and the use of CSS custom properties for managing styles. I also practiced implementing hover states for interactive elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus more on responsive design principles to ensure layouts adapt well to different screen sizes. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques and potentially incorporate CSS animations for enhanced user interaction.
